# Privacy Policy

Thank you for choosing to use "Word Wrecker" (the "App"), developed by Zenith Corps ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle and safeguard any data collected through the App.
